This project was made for Capital One's Software Engineering Summit. The purpose of this project is to help users find places to eat at through a website that will have a search engine using Yelp's Fusion API.

Due to not having experience using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I spent a lot of time learning the different languages and ways to integrate the API. Although I could not figure out how to integrate the API due to errors with CORS, I believe I created an aesthetic visual platform that can be used. As far as the API goes, I believe the code I have is very close to accessing the API but does have a few errors. With a desire to work for Capital One as an intern and as an employee in the future, I hope I can attend the Software Engineering Summit this summer.

Thank you for taking the time to review my project.
